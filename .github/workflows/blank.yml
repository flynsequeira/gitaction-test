# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "dev" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    types: ["opened", "synchronize", "reopened"]


# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Check source branch
        run: |
          echo "Source branch is ${{ github.head_ref }}"
          if [[ "${{ github.head_ref }}" != "qa" ]]; then
            echo "::warning::PRs into main must come from 'qa' branch. Please follow dev → qa → main flow."

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
